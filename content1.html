                        In the early 20th century, Eugène Paul Louis Schueller, a young French chemist, developed a hair
                        dye formula called Oréale. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then
                        decided to sell to Parisian hairdressers. On 31 July 1919, Schueller registered his company,
                        the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France).
                        The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and
                        innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the
                        team was 100 strong; by 1984 was 1,000 and is roughly 88,000 today (in 2020).

                        Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at L'Oréal headquarters.
                        La Cagoule was a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group whose leader formed a
                        political party Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in
                        Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans. L'Oréal hired several
                        members of the group as executives after World War II, such as Jacques Corrèze, who served as
                        CEO of the United States operation. Israeli historian Michael Bar-Zohar describes this in his
                        book, Bitter Scent.

                        L'Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other
                        cleansing and beauty products. L'Oréal currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of
                        individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling,
                        body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide
                        variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets,
                        health/beauty outlets, pharmacies and direct mail.

                    When Europeans first arrived at the site of present-day Toronto, the vicinity was inhabited by the
                    Iroquois, who had displaced the Wyandot (Huron) people, occupants of the region for centuries
                    before c. 1500. The name Toronto is likely derived from the Mohawk word tkaronto, meaning "place
                    where trees stand in the water". This refers to the northern end of what is now Lake Simcoe,
                    where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. However, the word "Toronto", meaning
                    "plenty" also appears in a 1632 French lexicon of the Huron language, which is also an Iroquoian
                    language. It also appears on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay,
                    Lake Simcoe, and several rivers. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through
                    this point, known as the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name. The site
                    of Toronto lay at the entrance to one of the oldest routes to the northwest, a route known and used
                    by the Huron, Iroquois, and Ojibwe, and was of strategic importance from the beginning of Ontario's
                    recorded history.

                    In the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon on
                    the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the
                    Mississauga had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver
                    Wars, with most returning to their contentland in present-day New York.

                    In the 17th century, the area was a crucial link for travel, with the Humber and Rouge rivers
                    providing a shortcut to the upper Great Lakes. These routes together were known as the Toronto
                    Passage.
                    French traders founded Fort Rouillé in 1750 (the current Exhibition grounds were later developed
                    here), but abandoned it in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The British defeated the French and
                    their indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of Quebec in
                    1763.

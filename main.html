                    Cosmetics are constituted from a mixture of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources,
                    or synthetically created ones. Cosmetics designed for skin care can be used to cleanse, exfoliate
                    and protect the skin, as well as replenishing it, through the use of cleansers, toners, serums,
                    moisturizers, and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general personal care, such as shampoo and body
                    wash, can be used to cleanse the body. Cosmetics designed to enhance one's appearance (makeup) can
                    be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes),
                    add color to a person's face and, in the case of more extreme forms of makeup used for performances,
                    fashion shows and people in costume, can be used to change the appearance of the face entirely to
                    resemble a different person, creature or object. Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to
                    the body.

                    Though the legal definition of cosmetics in most countries is broader, in some Western countries,
                    cosmetics are commonly taken to mean only makeup products, such as lipstick, mascara, eye shadow,
                    foundation, blush, highlighter, bronzer, and several other product types. In the United States, the
                    Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates cosmetics, defines cosmetics as products
                    "intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or
                    altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or functions". This broad definition
                    includes any material intended for use as an ingredient of a cosmetic product, with the FDA
                    specifically excluding pure soap from this category.

                    Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years. The absence of regulation of the manufacture and
                    use of cosmetics, as well as the absence of scientific knowledge regarding the effects of various
                    compounds on the human body for much of this time period, led historically to a number of negative
                    adverse effects upon those who used cosmetics, including deformities, blindness and in some cases
                    death. Examples of the prevalent usage of harmful cosmetics include the use of ceruse (white lead)
                    throughout a number of different cultures, such as during the Renaissance in the West, and blindness
                    caused by the mascara Lash Lure during the early 20th century.

                <p>
                    One of the earliest cultures to use cosmetics was ancient Egypt, where both Egyptian men and women
                    used makeup to enhance their appearance. The use of black kohl eyeliner and eyeshadows in dark
                    colours such as blue, red, and black was common, and was commonly recorded and represented in
                    Egyptian art, as well as being seen in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Ancient Egyptians also extracted red
                    dye from fucus-algin, 0.01% iodine, and some bromine mannite,vag but this dye resulted in
                    serious illness. Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially made using a pearlescent substance
                    found in fish scales, which are still used extensively today. Despite the hazardous nature of
                    some Egyptian cosmetics, ancient Egyptian makeup was also thought to have antibacterial properties
                    that helped prevent infections.

                    Ancient Sumerian men and women also wore makeup, being possibly the first culture to invent and wear
                    lipstick roughly 5,000 years ago, by crushing gemstones and decorating the face with them, mainly
                    on the lips, as well as around the eyes. The ancient Indus Valley Civilisation (3000-1500 BC)
                    also utilised makeup, with women applying red tinted lipstick to their lips for decoration.
                    Other cultures to use cosmetics include the ancient Greeks and the Romans. Cosmetics are
                    also mentioned in the Old Testament, such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where the biblical figure Jezebel
                    painted her eyelids (approximately 840 BC). Cosmetics are also mentioned in the book of Esther,
                    where beauty treatments are described.
                </p>
                According to one source, early major developments in cosmetics include:
                <ul>
                    <li> Kohl used by ancient Egyptians</li>
                    <li> Castor oil also used in ancient Egypt as a protective balm</li>
                    <li> Skin creams made of beeswax, olive oil, and rose water, described by the Romans</li>
                    <li> Vaseline and lanolin in the nineteenth century.</li>
                </ul>
                Use of cosmetics continued into the Middle Ages, where the face was whitened and the cheeks
                rouged; during the later 16th century in the West, the personal attributes of the women who used
                makeup created a demand for the product among the upper class.Cosmetics continued to be
                used in the following centuries, though attitudes towards cosmetics varied throughout time, with the
                use of cosmetics being openly frowned upon at many points in Western history. In the 19th century,
                Queen Victoria publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors,
                with many famous actresses of the time, such as Sarah Bernhardt and Lillie Langtry using makeup.

                Many cosmetic products available at this time were still either chemically dubious or derived from
                natural resources commonly found in the kitchen, such as food colouring, berries and beetroot.
                During the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead poisoning due to the fashion
                for red and white lead makeup and powder, leading to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened
                tooth enamel and blackening skin, with heavy use known to lead to death. Usage of white lead was not
                confined only to the West, with the white Japanese face makeup known as oshiroi also produced using
                white lead. However, in the second part of the 19th century, scientific advances in the production
                of makeup lead to the creation of makeup free of hazardous substances such as lead.
